<h1>Will GitHub work for me?</h>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>So the time has finally arrived for me to experiment with GitHub. I have watched the tutorial videos however I still feel
very overwhelmed with the amount of new information that I need to take in and the amount of time it is taking me to complete
simple tasks. I hope that as this course goes on, I will pick up tricks here and there and be able to adapt more quickly. </p>
